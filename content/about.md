## Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet!

My name is Alysa Gem Samaniego, but feel free to call me A.G.!

I am a senior in Information Sciences at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Much of my past experiences have been on the more technical side, having come from Computer Science before switching into the iSchool. Since then, I have focused more on business analytics, "culture [artifacts] as data" in my research projects, and user/market research. 

Among my professional work, I am also: 

- pursuing Digital Humanities research projects (think: website preservation, or analyzing Humanities-oriented datasets to extract patterns and insights)
- typesetting at [Skeuomorph Press](https://skeuomorph.ischool.illinois.edu/)
- reading a good book (current read: "Fabric: The Hidden History of the Material World" by Victoria Finlay)
- Analyzing fashion data from the lens of theory

If you'd like to learn more about me, check out my resume, or my blog for my newest adventures, hot takes, and discoveries, with more to come soon!
